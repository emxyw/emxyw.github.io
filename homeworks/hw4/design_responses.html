						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is the ratio provided by W3C for background to text. Contrast ratio itself is important because the less contrast there is, text becomes illegible since it blends in with the background. More specifically, until now I didn't know there was an actual metric for measuring the contrast ratio or a minimum rating so I found that very interesting. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the amount of tools and metrics provided that can help you determine the accessibility of your site in many different ways. For example, Trello uses different patterns to indicate colors for those who struggle with differentiating between hues and instead have to rely on patterns. Other helpful indicators include color combinations and accessbility ratings that really help you narrow down to how accessible you want your website to be.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> " In 2017, The World Health Organization estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment. That statistic alone is reason enough to design for accessibility." </p>
						</li>
