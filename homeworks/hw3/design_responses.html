					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article are the different resources available for inspiration and font pairing. Pairing is often something that is overlooked, but can be incredible when clarifying hierarchy and readability. When choosing fonts it's also important to first identify your audience, because some fonts are more effective towards certain groups than others. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is that they included different scales based on the golden ratio. They provided a variety of examples for what might appear to be small changes at first but actually impact the sizing of other elements. There are other ratios available to use as well, and finally at the end you can round off the decimals.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When choosing type, take into account your audience and their needs. Simply put, empathize with your users." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
