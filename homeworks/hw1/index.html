       <em>Intended Cognitive Science Major | 1st Year</em>
       <p>What's up my name is Emily and I like to draw and play league of legends during every minute I can spare. 
        I also love cooking and my favorite things to make include pasta salad and a variety of soups and chowders. 
        My favorite veggie is a carrot because I think they are really good for you and also they are very sweet. 
        I also love spicy food and I think I had an avocado allergy at some point in my life and yeah.

       <h3>Reading Response</h3>

        <li>Something I learned from the article is the use of unique placeholder text in areas such a the search bar in the article's example. While it doesn't have to be something super interesting, just presenting possibilites of what people might search for really opens up the site's capabilities. </li>
        <li>My favorite part of the article was the author's use of gifs to decontruct various interfaces. Just being able to see it built from the top down makes it less overwhelming and complicated but at the same time shows how much composition really matters because the moment everything is in place does it really feel complete. </li>
        <li>I really loved how the author opened up the article with this: "I was obsessed with copying pieces of the trending Dribbble shots, but oblivious to how all the pieces worked together."</li>
        <li>On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate this somewhere between an 7 and 8 because there could definitely be more elaboration on some of the techniques she talked about</li>
